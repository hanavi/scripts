## (My Personal Scripts)

### Overview
This is just a collection of random scripts that I happen to write.  I am
mostly uploading them here so I can access them on all my systems.  Though, if
people actually find them useful that would be great to hear!  The scripts are
not very dynamic, as they are really designed to meet a particular need, but
most are simple enough that they shouldn't be hard to customize.

### Current Scripts

* **randword** - Generate a random set of words using the built in unix/linux
  dict file

* **macspoof** - Generate a random MAC address for a system running El Capitan
  (Probably more OSX versions as well)
